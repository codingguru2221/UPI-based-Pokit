# *Project Title*

*UPI-Powered Smart Pocket Money Management System for Minors*

---

## *Single Consolidated Project Argument*

In India, most parents give their children monthly pocket money for daily expenses such as food, travel, and small purchases. However, children below 18 years of age usually cannot use UPI directly because a bank account and ATM card are mandatory. This creates a gap where parents want to encourage digital payments and financial learning, but also want control, safety, and visibility over their children’s spending.

To solve this problem, we propose a *Parent-Controlled, UPI-Powered Pocket Money Application* where a parent links their own UPI account and creates *sub-accounts for their children. The parent assigns a fixed monthly pocket money amount, which is distributed across predefined spending categories such as food, travel, online shopping, and others. Children can make UPI payments only at **approved and limited places*, while every transaction is recorded and visible to the parent.

The key innovation of this system is that *category limits are flexible but the total balance is fixed. If a category limit (for example, food) is exhausted but the child still has remaining balance in other categories, the system automatically allows the transaction without blocking it. This avoids real-life problems where parents may not be available to approve every request. For critical cases where both the category limit and total balance are exceeded, a **real-time parent approval notification* is triggered, and the transaction succeeds only if the parent approves it.

Additionally, the child is provided with a *controlled dashboard* where they can responsibly *reallocate limits between categories during emergencies*, without increasing the total balance. This teaches budgeting, prioritization, and financial responsibility, while maintaining parental oversight. Parents receive full transparency through dashboards and notifications, ensuring trust and safety.

Once the child turns 18, the same account can be seamlessly converted into a *normal UPI account*, giving the child full independence without changing the platform.
